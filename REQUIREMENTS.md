This file exists because of the A3 Report, as it was required for a REQUIREMENTS.md to exist (to define functional requirements of the project). But to not cause any confusion with files such as _requirements.txt_ (which contains the python libraries), all the requirements are present in the file [AtivadadeA3.md](Documentation/Report&#32;A3/AtividadeA3.md) inside the Documentation folder.
